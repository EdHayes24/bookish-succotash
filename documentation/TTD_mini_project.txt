TTD Mini Project
# Update modified Products_operations menu to the main script
# Consider a generic function for updating list of dictionaries and data type expected in tuples?
# Investigate the effect of products_list being a list of dictionaries on the other functions
# 


Actions:
# Added a literal shallow copy of a product dictionary using <dict_obj>.copy()
# ^^ enables use of commit_changes(original_object, new_object)
# Completed Actions:
16/11/22 - Print orders list sorted by courier &/or by order_status
16/11/22 - Corrected options_selector error when input = -1 (negative list index printing not caught before Error Message)
16/11/22 - Added Conversion of String Representation of List to List upon Loading of couriers_list["Orders"] from CSV using DictReader

TTD NEW:
15/11/22: INCOMPLETE
- Function to add to a specific data type key in a dictionary?

16/11/22: INCOMPLETE
- On Order Creation, append order_ID to Courier Dictionary
- Check the Order Update and Courier Updates don't invalidate one another - should we be able to mutate both sides?
- Update the Order_ID when the Name on the order changes in both the courier dict and the order dict
- Add Unit tests for file handling helper functions
- Add Unit tests for decoration helper functions 
- Add Unit tests for unique_str_helper_functions
- Remove Shallow/Deep Copy operations which clutter code 
- Fix messy order_by for printing orders_list. Can we do similar for the Products and Couriers Lists?
- Add a Readmne File
