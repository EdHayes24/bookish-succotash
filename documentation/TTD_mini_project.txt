TTD Mini Project
# Update modified Products_operations menu to the main script
# Consider a generic function for updating list of dictionaries and data type expected in tuples?
# Investigate the effect of products_list being a list of dictionaries on the other functions
# 


Actions:
# Added a literal shallow copy of a product dictionary using <dict_obj>.copy()
# ^^ enables use of commit_changes(original_object, new_object)


TTD NEW:

Add check if unique in list functionality to make_string_unique(obj, list_of_obj) function
instead of doing the check before calling?
Different function: search for key in list of dicts?
Fucntion to add to a specific data type key in a dictionary?
