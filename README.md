# Bookish-Succotash
A Cafe Order Menu System for managing products, couriers and orders in a CLI interface using Python.
Client Requirements included:
- CLI navigable main menu to reach submenus for Products, Order and Courier operations
- Ability to print, add, update/amend and remove: Products, Orders, Couriers
- Commit data structures containing Product, Order and Courier information to files
- Products Attributes include: Name, Price
- Order Attributes include: Name, Address, Telephone, Items, Courier, Order Status, ID
- Courier Attributes include: Name, Orders

## Development
Initial client requirements built up from storing list of strings to text files to represent products, orders and couriers. Updating of these requirements provided the context for additional attributes, menu recursion and storing products as lists of dictionaries saved to CSV files.
The approach follows Functional Programming, with each menu and submenu housed in it's own def function wrapper with recursion to navigate between different menu functions.
Each menu function is supported by an array of helper functions as tabulated below:
